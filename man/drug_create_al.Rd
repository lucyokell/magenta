\description{
Create list describing parameters for AL drug efficacy and prophlyaxis
}
\note{
We have curves of the longest and shortest duration of AL prophylaxis from 
Bretscher et al. However, we have multiple types of partner drug resistance. 
At the moment we will say that any loci associated with lumefantrine resistance
yield the resistant curve but it may be better to have a distinct curve for each
lumefantrine resistant genotype with the T0.5 aligned to the prob of lpf.

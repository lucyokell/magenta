\arguments{
\item{resistance_flag}{Boolean are we simulating resistance}

\item{number_of_resistance_loci}{Numeric for number of res. loci}

\item{artemisinin_loci}{Numerics for barcode positions that confer artemisinin 
resistance}

\item{cost_of_resistance}{Numeric vector for fitness cost of each resistance loci.}

\item{absolute_fitness_cost_flag}{Boolean are we simulating fitness costs as
absolute (i.e. impactive onward transmission chance) or relative (resistant
strains have decreases chance of being onwardly transmitted in mixed 
infections). Default = FALSE.}

\item{epistatic_logic}{Is there compensatory relationships. i.e. what loci 
need to be true for resistance cost to exist. Default of NULL means that 
this becomes seq_len(number_of_resistance_loci), i.e. only dependent on 
their own loci. (TODO: Change this to be a list of length norl)}

\item{number_of_drugs}{Numeric for number of drugs used}

\item{drugs}{List of drugs that are being used, with each list element being
created by \code{drug_create}.}

\item{mft_flag}{Boolean are we doing mft}

\item{temporal_cycling}{Numeric for when in years a drug switch occurs}

\item{sequential_cycling}{Numeric for what perc. treatment failure before switch}

\item{sequential_update}{How long does it take in years for sequential to be implemented}

\item{drug_choice}{What's the default drug choice to begin. Default = 0}

\item{partner_drug_ratios}{Numeric vector OR array for ratio of first line drugs used - changed to array over multiple years.}
